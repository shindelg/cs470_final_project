To do this, RSPO members were required to file a return to LUCA. This we did in November 2014.After this declaration, we were asked to produce the satellite images of the parcels declared at the date of 2005 in order to allow the team to conduct its analysis and finalize the procedure. At this request, we could not respond favorably because of our difficulty in producing these images because of the unavailability of the technology that can allow us to achieve this. We have through our multiple exchanges, shared with our interlocutors, including Mr. Dillon Samir, this difficulty.Despite this difficulty, we conducted research that led us to contact an international consultant, \'SATELLIGENCE\', also confirming the impossibility of making available these images.However, another option could lead to the desired result, it is a report detailing the information on the plots, he said. Therefore, we have decided to conduct this study with the said consultant and a report has been prepared by him. This report was made available to the LUCA team to enable its analysis to be conducted. The report of the expert according to the return to us by the LUCA team can not help to carry out the analysis.Thanks to the public consultation of the Africa zone organized on the 10th, 11th and 12th of October 2017 in Accra in which we took part, we expressed our difficulties to Mr. SALAHUDIN YAACOB who put us in contact with a member of the team that speaks French in the person of Mr. BAHKTIAR TALHAH and his other colleagues (DILLON SMIR, KHING SU LI, NUR AINA SAMIR), with whom we have long exchanged. The same difficulties arose because of the particularity of DEKELOIL in the agroindustrial world. You could through the file attached to this mail, observe and understand this difficulty for DEKELOIL to carry out the ESIA and HVC studies for about 103 parcels scattered throughout the Sud-ComoÌ© region.In view of all these difficulties and the numerous efforts made by our company which has embarked on the certification path to the RSPO standard, we have requested an extension to clarify and find a solution that will allow us to finalize our clearing procedure.",- We have already started by raising the awareness of small producers of the use of good practices ;- Training and supervision of producers on good agricultural practices ;- Clarify our status for the LUCA procedure with the Africa RSPO officer ;,other,"-Improved collaboration with our buyers and suppliers by informing them of your intention to modify or improve our manufacturing processes;-Invest in technology that can transfer our requirements to suppliers quickly, which will improve our time to market; -Use of information technology to forecast sales, supplies, purchases, orders, shipments, deliveries, and so on; -Use customized software solutions to help us in the process of managing your supply chain.

At the economic level : -Competition; - Failure to comply with the rules issued by the oil palm sector in CÌ«te d\'Ivoire, resulting in the inability of industrialists to support producers in terms of agricultural advice, the rehabilitation of roads and the professionalization of cooperatives.At the social level : -The dispersal of our plantations throughout the Sud-ComoÌ© region makes it difficult or even impossible to satisfy all these stakeholders, hence the dissatisfaction of these stakeholders; - Failure to comply with the contracts signed by our partners for the creation of the plans strongly hampers the supply to our plant in palm of oil palm bunches At the environmental level,Our biggest constraint is the cost of conducting HVC studies for new plantations. Indeed, the very high cost of these HVC studies severely limits the acquisition of new land to the extent or in CÌ«te d\'Ivoire, it is no longer possible to have an area of ??more than 1,000 hectares of a single taking. As part of efforts to alleviate or resolve these problems,On the economic level, we try to lobby the oil palm sector for the implementation of laws to the management of the sector. At the social level, we recently carried out a Social Impact Assessment (SIA) of our plantations (March 2017) and the results are being used for the implementation of the recommendations. At the environmental level, especially the constraint linked to the high cost of HCV studies, we believe that consideration should be given to the possibility of reducing costs according to the sensitivities of each country. Indeed, the very high cost of these HVC studies severely limits the acquisition of new land in CÌ«te d\'Ivoire, it is no longer possible to have an area of more than 1,000 hectares of a single taking.Another difficulty faced by our company this year is our clearing procedure.Indeed as indicated above, we have not been able to provide the images as claimed by LUCA for the simple reason that the technology to do so does not exist for CÌ«te d\'Ivoire. We contacted an expert in Holland (SATELIGENCE) who confirmed this information and carried out the study for us. The report is available. Unfortunately the representatives of RSPO LUCA rejected the report and promised to put their technician to help us to obtain the images to finalize our procedure. To this day we are still waiting for these images despite our multiple reminders.Since our approach towards RSPO certification is highly dependent on this procedure, we contacted the RSPO Africa Manager to outline our difficulties. He advised us to carry out the HVC and EIES studies for all our plantations (156). Moreover, he advises us to take a sample to carry out the studies.We believe that this approach is not the right one as far as the information sought by LUCA is the development or not of plantations on possible areas of HCV.However, in the environmental legislation in CÌ«te d\'Ivoire (decree n å¡ 96-894 of November 8, 1996 determining the rules and procedures applicable to studies relating to the environmental impact of projects in the Republic of CÌ«te d\'Ivoire) in annex 1, the impact studies are carried out from 999 hectares and the law makes it possible to make a categorical exclusion statement which is report justifying the categorical exclusion when a project does not appear in any of the categories mentioned in appendices I, II and III of the it benefits from a categorical exclusion that exempts it a priori from an Environmental Impact Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement.",-We funded study tours for cooperatives;-We have offered our site to test the RSPO-certified auditors ; -We are in partnership ;-With SOLIRIDARIDAD for its RSSF / RSPO project ;

Since 2004, Fedepalma has been a member of the RSPO and has promoted the implementation of the RSPO P&C within the Colombian oil palm sector.Between 2013 and 2016, Fedepalma was part of the Colombian National Interpretation Task Force. Once the NI was endorsed by the RSPO in September 2016, Fedepalma published the NI and has organized several workshops in the four oil palm growingregions in Colombia to socialize it. During 2018, Fedepalma and the RSPO Latin America office will organize the VII Latin American Oil Palm Conference in June. Also, Fedepalma will participate in the public consultation of the RSPO P&C Review; will publish a guideline for HCV assessments in Colombia with WWF; and will continue supporting palm oil companies in Colombia that are seeking for RSPO certification. Since 2012, Fedepalma has been implementing a US$4.25 million GEF-Project that aims to mainstream biodiversity conservation in oil palm regions. The Project runs until July 2018 and has generated several guidelines and pilot implementation of HCV and landscape management tolos.  ","With regards to the supply chain, Fedepalma is working together with WWF, Proforest, Solidaridad and The Forest Trust in helping refiners and other companies that source Colombian palm oil to develop partnerships with mills and plantations to support their RSPO certification.",unknown,-,n,-,n,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"While promoting the adoption of the RSPO P&C amongst Colombian oil palm growers, we have encountered the following obstacles: 1. Remediation and Compensation procedure: the RaCP is too complex for companies in Latin America, most of which end up with only a few hectares to compensate. Having to go through the procedure and approval of the concept note and compensation plan for less tan 100 hectares is too much for a single company. 2. RSPO certification for smallholders. More tan 80% of Colombian oil palm growers are smallholders, and in many cases, their starting point is too far away from achieving certification. Fedepalma is currently working with Solidaridad to develop a step-wise approach that could help smallholders have a clearer path on how to advance towards certification. ","In 2017, Fedepalma: (a) was part of the Latin American RSPO Consultative Group and a member of the RSPO Biodiversity and HCV Working Group; (b) helped smallholder groups develop proposals for the RSPO smallholders fund; (c) organized several on-site trainings on best management practices for the production of sustainable palm oil, as part of its extension programme."

Uptake of CSPO could be better considering the efforts growers are putting in to get our plantations certified2. For our food ingredients,  in order to drive change in terms of sustainable sourcing, we have been proactive in our approach. We have continued to promote the segregation route to our customers. SG & IP are the only RSPO systems that allow for the claim of ‰ÛÏsustainable‰Û� to be made, however, downstream players are not all buying into this model. In our experience some pass off MB as being sustainable, when it is only recognised to contribute towards sustainable development. Others see traceability as sustainability when it is actually only a tool to be used within the verification process.For change to be seen at origins we feel it is crucial that costs are shared in terms of premiums to be passed on to origin suppliers. For sustainable sourcing to be achieved, the models have to make viable business sense for all within the supply chain, as such, collaborative efforts are needed. Currently sales of RSPO physically certified material do not align with that being produced.The RSPO P&Cs to include RSPO Next. Currently there are two producers providing RSPO Next material. For our food ingredients, we have had to seek avenues outside of the RSPO Certification in a bid to find answers that may help to resolve some of the issues, this can be costly & time consuming, especially when considering the number of mills associated with conventional & MB supplies.3, Market transformation needed for key buyer markets such as India","For our food ingredients, we have actively promoted RSPO SG as the route to sustainable sourcing. The RSPO models form a stepping stone route, however, the intent to source sustainable material has to be at the forefront of commercial decision making. There is no timeframe set by which companies have to move from one RSPO model to the next, without this it is likely that some will put off making this commitment. We have raised this as a concern with the RSPO.With 2020 sustainability commitments drawing closer for all commodities, most companies in Europe are coming to the realisation that for palm oil sourcing to be verified legitimately, that they have to move to SG to achieve this. Some, are not willing to pay the premiums & are looking towards ‰ÛÏPalm Free‰Û� sourcing in order to meet their goals. This we believe makes it all the more important that the RSPO SG is promoted as the route to take & that timeframes are established to direct companies in the right direction, that being RSPO recognised certified sustainable palm. OFI have engaged with our suppliers in assessment and capacity building exercises, with the aim of supporting transformation within our supply chains.

We continue sensitization in the field by our agents and during frequent stakeholder consultations we organise.Environmentally most smallholders had practices that were contrary to sound environmental practices like responsible use of pesticides and the use of fire for land preparation. The HCV notion was also very new to these smallholder and a lot of sensitisation work and demonstrations had to be done to overcome these obstacles.

At the time of purchase PT SSS had approvals and possession of HGU no 42 (Land Title) for 2,508.472 ha issued by the National Land Authority/BPN Kotawaringin Barat on 9 August 2005 and the remaining of å± 13,000 ha had been further processed application of HGU ‰ÛÒ in 2007 up to the Cadastral (Land Office Boundary Confirmation) ref.113.540.42.2007. The Land Boundary Confirmation was based on Spatial Management Plan (RTRWP 2003) for Central Kalimantan Province, which mapped and designated this area as non-forest land (KKP -Kawasan Pengembangan Produksi and KPPL-Kawasan Pemukiman dan Penggunaan Lain).  In 2008, PT SSS received a letter from the National Land Authority (BPN-Badan Pertanahan Nasional) that the process for application of HGU of å± 13,000 ha was postponed as a result of the forest land release (Izin Pelepasan Kawasan Hutan) issued by the Ministry of Forestry (Reference Letter No.800.540.42 dated September 2008) due to the discrepancy between RTRWP 2003 and TGHK (Tata Guna Hutan Kesepakatan) 1982,  which is prevalent in Kalimantan Tengah. As per TGHK 1982, PT SSS‰Ûªs land was partially in the forest zone area.  PT SSS accordingly submitted an application for land release (Izin Pelepasan)  since 5 June 2009 based on PP no 10 year of 2010. Unfortunately the process in securing the required  land release documents  were held back due to ongoing uncertainties by the Local and Central Government on whether to follow RTRWP 2003 or TGHK 1982 and also the fact that there was No Bupati of Kalimantan Barat District  untill the end of 2011, hence bringing all decisions to a standstill.   With the appointment of the new Bupati towards end 2011, the process of PT SSS\'s land release was completed and submitted to the Forestry Ministry. However in April 2012, PT SSS  received a letter from the Ministry of Forestry stating the application for forest release would be postponed until the \'harmonization process\' of the zoning map based on RTRWP 2003 with the new forestry map of 2011 (changing TGHK 1982 map)  had been completed pending the amendment of the \'Peraturan Pemerintah No.10, 2010\' concerning converting the forest zone use and functions according to the Director of General Planology, Forestry Ministry No.S.431/V11-KLH/2012, dated 19th April 2012. On 6th July 2012 The President of The Republic of Indonesia issued the amendment of the Peraturan Pemerintah No.10 year 2010,namely Peraturan Pemerintah No.60 year 2012.   From the flow chart of PP No 60 of 2012, any company affected by the \'harmonization process has to go back to the drawing board and initiate the forest release application according to the new regulation.   In this respect, PT SSS has successfully obtained the Pelepasan Decree from the Investment Coordinating Board on behalf of the Environment and Forestry Minister  for 5,122.73 ha on 20 March 2015. For this 5,122.73 ha, HGU application shall be able to proceed to BPN.  However, the 4,717.03 ha of HP area are still in the process of Land Swap under the PP no 60 year 2012.  Meanwhile, PT SSS\'s application for land release of 1,769.61 ha of land in the forest zone  from its  original HGU area of 2,508.47 was not supported by  the Land Office, as the Land Office is of the opinion that once HGU is approved (as under KPP/KPPL in RTRWP 2003) there is no necessity to apply for land release, very much contrary to the Ministry of Forestry\'s stand. PT SSS had envisaged to certify this 2,508.47 ha of HGU area in its Lada Estate in Q4 of 2016 as per its time bound plan. However due to the difference in opinions  between the Land Office and the Ministry of Forestry, which of late has surfaced,PT SSS has to postpone its time bound plan.   The President of The Republic of Indonesia issued Peraturan Pemerintah 104, 2015 dated 28 Dec 2015 and made available to the public  in early  2016 a new protocol for the \'harmonization process\' replacing PP 60/2012. This will prolong the process of 4,717.03 ha of HP area Land Swap ; as the re application has been submitted by 17 February 2016 to the Forestry Deparment.  PT SSS is in the process now submitting all documents for its 1769.61ha (from its original HGU) to the Investment Coordinating Board/ Badan Koordinasi Penamanan Model/BKPM. PTSSS has appeared for Initial RSPO Assessment for the balance of 713.47ha on 11th to 14th December 2017, however the Certification Body will only take a certification decision on acceptance of the Company‰Ûªs Remediation and Compensation Plan (RaCP) by RSPO. The Company\'s Final Compensation Liability (FCL) has been approved and its RaCP concept note has been also approved and currently the final budget planning is work in progress . The Company has (12) twelve months from the initial assessment to obtain the approval of the RaCP Budget and Plan.  The Company had proposed in its time bound plan to seek certification in 4th quarter of 2017 and 2018 for Lada and Runtu Estate on the clean and clear HGU portion and the area where Panitia B (final step before issuance of HGU) had been completed. However on 12th October 2017, the RSPO Statement on Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) - Indonesia has stated: RSPO grower members that are not certified and want to apply for RSPO certification, must show evidence of possession of a legitimate Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) and Izin Usaha Perkebunan (IUP) for the intended unit of certification. We are now pleased to inform that the long overdue HGU for 6004.15 ha was received on 12th March 2018. This portion will go in for extension of scope audit soon. The other portion pending HGU are in the land swap phase and its HGU issuance is beyond our control. The Company in view of several sudden and unexpected changes in legislation and laws by the authorities, combined with deferring views between the National and Regional bodies in terms of land tenure and designation as explained in detail as above and the recent RSPO Statement on HGU which is totally beyond its control is now compelled to defer its time bound plan.",2020,All our Plasma scheme are managed by PT.SSS and thus the certification will be in tandem with PTSSS.,2022,"The outside crop received in our Lada Palm Oil Mill are from non-associated smallholders and outgrowers and we will continue to educate them in RSPO P&Cs , however they have an option to sent elsewhere.

Until such time the HGU will not be issued .It is a prerequisite that HGU must be obtained for RSPO certification. We have submitted our application for outstanding HGU areas and expect to obtain it by 3rd Quarter of 2018 and in tandem with its issuance we will seek certification in 2018-2020 for our plantations in Indonesia.For the new Indonesian Estates, UP had targeted to move towards RSPO and ISPO certification in 2017.  This was achieved for part of our HGU area as our subsidiary in Indonesia underwent the RSPO and ISPO initial main assessment on the 11th to the 15th December  2017 and is awaiting issuance of the certificates.  The Time Bound Plan for all the areas being certified will be in tandem with the hectarage issued with HGU certificates by the Government of Indonesia. This is expected by 2020.

The recent Smallholder‰Ûªs Field Day was held on 11th November 2017. We invited 80 smallholders from local districts to visit our plantations to get a better understanding of good agricultural practices, sustainability initiatives and environmental protection. We are pleased to inform that 59 smallholders or equivalent to 74% of the smallholders attended the Smallholders Field Day. The smallholders were given training sessions in safe handling of pesticides with appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), effective use of pre-emergent herbicides for less chemical usage, integrated pest management (IPM) and mechanized harvesting in order to assist them with their agricultural interests.In addition, demonstration on fire combat procedures were carried out to further enhance the awareness of neighbouring smallholders in case of fire incidence and were informed to contact UP for emergency assistance within the close vicinity.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,"The opportunity loss by not developing more areas through further expansion as we are committed to preserve conservation areas and have committed to strict standards of the RSPO including the add on criteria of No deforestation, No Peat land development, HCS assessments and all elements involved with that. In addition, it has been a tough journey identifying customers that are willing to pay a premium for CSPO solutions. Fortunately this is changing now and we do see more demand which hopefully entice producers and not be a demotivating factor for producers. Smallholders also don\'t have the means to rush into certification due to costs and hence it takes time for full certification throughout the organization including smallholders. Smallholders require more time in certification and therefore can prolong and delay a fully certified supply chain. It is therefore good that there are time-bound plans in order for all to work together for certification including smallholders and plasma groups. Government permits in Indonesia takes much time in pursuing and being issued hence delaying the process of certification. In terms of social obstacles we have spent much time and money trying to solve land issues which is a common problem for Plantations companies in Indonesia. It takes much time and effort, however, with the various procedures in Place and by following the FPIC principle progress has been made. Initially the communities around our operations had great mistrust in the new owners and management, due to many broken promises earlier, however, with genuine commitment and social awareness including seriousness in developing plasma areas, participating in the local society and promoting CSR projects, the social collaboration with the surrounding communities have improved significantly. We have had an uphill task in trying to preserve our conservation areas as many members of the community are aware of the timber value in the trees. With poverty and financial constraints amongst the communites, it is of key importance to spend time in trying to convince communities to retain the conservation areas. This will take time and much effort is being placed on finding a balance between economy and ecology. We have established a Biodiversity Department and work with Copenhagen Zoo in order to establish a first class example on how plantation development can go hand in hand with environmental protection and conservation.","Our organization started working with stakeholders involved with the RSPO in 2004.
